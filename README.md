This is a MERN stack project with Next.js (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend) for uploading and viewing 2D/3D AutoCAD files (DWG/DXF).

It uses Autodesk Forge API to convert and display models interactively.

Admin credentials are stored in the backend .env file, and you can access the admin panel by using the credentials specified there. 

Additionally, to enable the Autodesk Forge API functionality, make sure to add your Forge API credentials (client ID and secret) in the .env file for the app to work properly.
